# Provenance & third-party licensing

The micro-topics, the prerequisite graph, and all of Marble's authored text are original work, released under ODbL 1.0 + CC BY-SA 4.0 (see [README](README.md#license)).

**`data/curriculum-standards.json` is different.** Those standards are extracted from external curriculum frameworks that Marble does **not** own and **cannot** relicense. You can only receive from us the rights the upstream holders grant. Each source's terms — and exactly what we ship — are below.


## The "codes-only" distinction

For encumbered sources we ship only the **standard code** (e.g. `1-ESS1-1`) and its key — a short **factual identifier**, low copyright risk — and we **omit the verbatim standard text** (`description`, `clarificationStatement`, etc.). The topic→standard *links* in `topics.json` are unaffected, so "this topic maps to standard X" is preserved throughout. Sources marked `textIncluded: false` in `curriculum-standards.json` are codes-only.

## Per-source terms

## Changing what ships

The export tool takes a per-source switch. To (re)include a source's full text after clearing rights, regenerate with that slug removed from the codes-only set:

```bash
# ship everything verbatim
DATABASE_URL=… node exportTaxonomy.mjs --codes-only=
# default (encumbered sources codes-only)
DATABASE_URL=… node exportTaxonomy.mjs
```
